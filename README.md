# Techdegree Project 7

For this project, I had to take a mockup and a few icons and build a beautiful, web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. I only needed to take the design and create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for this one page -- I don't need to create other pages, or build any backend or database functionality.

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to:

- Display at least two notifications at the same time when the user clicks the notifications bell icon.
- Create a navigation similar to the one in the mockup to display different data when the Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly button is selected. Add functionality to the Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly buttons so that a different line chart is displayed on click.
- Add an "autocomplete" feature for the "Search for User" box, listing names that match the search term. Which I used a W3 function to do so.
- Use local storage to save the settings. The settings are saved to local storage when the "Save" button is clicked, the settings are reset when the "Cancel" button is clicked, and when page is reloaded, the settings are remembered.
